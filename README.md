# Guacamole Workshop
This repository contains the course material for the Guacamole Workshop (DTL Programmers Meeting, 23rd of June 2017).

## Goal
The goal is to get hands-on experience in setting up Guacamole and using its REST api to manage connections and build a web service. In the interest of time, we will be using docker containers as much as possible throughout the tutorials. 

## Contents
This workshop consists of an [intermediate](/intermediate) exercise in which we use Guacamole to make Blender available in the browser. In the [advanced](/advanced) exercise, we work with the Guacamole REST api to build a small webservice for Blender. Each exercise has a /completed directory that contains the files for the completed exercise ([intermediate/completed](/intermediate/completed/) & [advanced/completed](/advanced/completed/)).
