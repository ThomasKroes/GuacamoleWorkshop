# Guacamole Workshop
This repository contains the course material for the Guacamole Workshop (DTL Programmers Meeting, 23rd of June 2017).

## Goal
The goal is to get hands-on experience in setting up Guacamole and using its REST api to manage connections.

## Contents
This workshop consists of an [intermediate](https://github.com/ThomasKroes/GuacamoleWorkshop/intermediate) tutorial in which we use Guacamole to make Blender available in the browser. In the [advanced](https://github.com/ThomasKroes/GuacamoleWorkshop/Advanced) tutorial, we work with the Guacamole REST api to build a small webservice for Blender.

Below are links to PDF's that will guide you through the workshop:
