# Guacamole Workshop
This repository contains the course material for the Guacamole Workshop (DTL Programmers Meeting, 23rd of June 2017).

## Goal
The goal is to get hands-on experience in setting up Guacamole and using its REST api to manage connections.

## Contents
This workshop consists of an [intermediate](/intermediate) tutorial in which we use Guacamole to make Blender available in the browser. In the [advanced](/advanced) tutorial, we work with the Guacamole REST api to build a small webservice for Blender. Each tutorial has a /completed directory that contains the files for the completed tutorial ([intermediate/completed](/intermediate/completed/) & [advanced/completed](/advanced/completed/)). 

Below are links to PDF's that will guide you through the workshop:
