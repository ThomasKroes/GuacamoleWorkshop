# Intermediate exercise
The goal of this exercise is to make Blender available in the browser using Guacamole. In the interest of time, this exercise will be run locally on your system using Docker containers. Exposing the service to the outside world is beyond the scope of this exercise (of course guidance can be provided off-line).
